# Options

Jovian-NixOS adds a set of extra options that can be used in your NixOS configurations under the `jovian` prefix.

Most of these options are implementation details, and likely are not needed to be changed.

See the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) page and the [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) page for the options that matter.
