# Packages

Jovian-NixOS provides an overlay with a set of extra packages.

Most of these packages are used implicitly from the Jovian NixOS configuration, and are an implementation detail.

See the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) page and the [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) page for the options that will end-up using or enabling them.
